			<p> This website was created by ambitious Rutgers Computer Science students during a Hackathon Event in the Spring of 2013. The idea behind this creation was influenced by the common game of Manhunt, which can also be associated with the game Assasins. Behind the scenes, the website utilizes the APIs curtesy of SendGrid and Twilio. Below are the great masterminds behind this creation.
